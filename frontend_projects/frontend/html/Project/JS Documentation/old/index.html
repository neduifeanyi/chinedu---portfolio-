          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.</p>

<code>It is a small and lightweight language
</code>
<p>Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. <b>Core JavaScript</b> can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with <i>additional</i> objects; for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
</li>
<li>For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
</li>
<li>HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
</li>
<li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.
<code>For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database.
</code> provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
</li>
</ul>

          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. </p>
          <p>JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

You can declare a variable in three ways:
        </p>
<p>
  You can declare a variable in three ways:
With the keyword var. For example,
var x = 42.
This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
<code>
By simply assigning it a value. For example,
x = 42.
</code>
<p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.

<code>With the keyword let. For example,
let y = 13.</code>
<p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
